                    <p class="content">
                            Satya was introduced to <b>RSS</b>  at a young age of 5 by his father. It’s ideology and  teachings attracted him into nationalism and transformed the young mind to serve the society. Being part of the organization since a young age has made him to interact with eminent leaders of various streams /backgrounds and firmed his mind to work towards betterment  of the  society. As a swayam sevak (RSS) since childhood, Satya would combine his ancient values and modern requirements in solving the problems existing in the society. His optimism and leadership qualities  was demonstrated in a 2004 incident in Ongole where he was part of the team to conduct “Dharma Sammelanam”. It was a ritual to be perform by 200 dalit families of Dattareya colony. The successful conduct of the ritual not only earned  him appreciations from dalit community but also groomed his way for a visionary leader under RSS. <br> As a RSS swayam sevak Satya  actively participated in rehabilitation of 2005 tsunami victims. <br> 

 
 
He travelled extensively along with the  activists to Ongole  villages educating villagers about <b>Sethu Samudram  Project</b>  and over protection of heritage property. He was detained in the protest for the above cause along with other Kar sevaks. Satya also participated in the protest against  kanchi pontiff and was taken under preventive detention . <br> 
 
As  a full time RSS pracharak he worked for many fishing villages of Prakasam district namely Chellemmagiripalem, Wollapalem and Pakala. <br> Working under RSS he understood the social stigma  existing in the society, the discrimination among castes/communities, various existing evil practices and strengthened  himself to work for their betterment in the  society. He worked in area bastis to improve quality of life for the people living there. Satya devoted himself in addressing their issues and grievances. He even broke bread with dalit families in their homes to instill confidence among them to be part of the comprehensive development. <br> His volunteering services came to a halt with sudden demise of his father. He had to  take up financial and household responsibilities at a young age of 18. The death of his father made him face the harsh reality of our existing social system. Having been born in a upper caste Brahmin family, Satya  could not avail the financial scholarship to continue his studies, as they were meant only for the socially backward  of the society as reservations and scholarship were primarily available to lower castes (who were stigmatized in the past and mandal  commission introduced by then PM V P Singh (1990 August 7 )  to allow them in mainstream.) <br> This phase of personal hardships exposed him to similar stories of many Brahmin families and youth who were suffering and leading a life of poverty, a side effect of reservations which was boon for many but bane for families like them. Determined to empower the Brahmin youths Satya started a organization called <b>Brahmin Yuva Kendra</b>  in to help Brahmin youth by skill trainings. The organization was formally registered in 2010 and is successfully helping the needy youth
